<p>Before you start reading, this is probably not the “best” solution, it takes ~500ms to run in C++ which is alot but unlike the other posted solutions (which are either AI-gen or do not work) this one works even after the extra test cases were added.</p>
<h1 id="intuition">Intuition</h1>
<p>Like the other approaches, the idea here is similar, we will not be able to reach from (0, 0) to (X, Y) if the path is blocked in the following ways: (blocked here refers to the intersecting circles forming a “line” of sorts)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Left to Right</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Left to Bottom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Top to Right</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Top to Bottom</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>(these lines represent intersecting circles)</p>
<p>A common approach people were using (and i did during the contest as well) was to use Union Find (via Disjoint Set Union) to create a “graph” of sorts where circles which intersected would be considered part of the same set. And then based on that, we can find if a circle which is “touching” the left boundary and a circle “touching” the right/bottom boundary are part of the same set and if they are then we clearly cannot reach (X, Y) [this also applied to top boundary to bottom boundary and so on].</p>
<p>There are 2 problems with this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>The case where circles intersect outside the rectangle are not considered-</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/50f290f5-48ec-4ca1-b07e-a5391de44fac_1723024503.161136.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Here, we can see that despite there being a “line” (in red) from top boundary to right boundary (which satisfies condition #3 of path blockage), there is still a valid path (in blue).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The condition of “touching” the boundary itself was taken incorrectly in most solutions-</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/c466e6a5-ba2c-4d9e-92b8-f3e6c7e0abbb_1723024763.653382.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Most solutions’ condition for checking if circle was touching the boundary or not will fail in cases like these, since their condition (if xi + r &gt;= X &amp;&amp; x &lt;= X | | xi - r &lt;= X &amp;&amp; x &gt;= X) will give true for the above example image as well, but as is evident here and in Test Case 4 (which was added later), this circle is touching neither of the boundaries.</p>
<h1 id="approach">Approach</h1>
<p>To solve this problem, both of these issues with previous approaches need to be discussed.</p>
<p>#1 Outwards Connection</p>
<p>The first issue can be fixed by only connecting (in our DSU) circles which have a point of intersection INSIDE our rectangle.</p>
<p>As we know, 2 circles can have either 0, 1 or 2 points of intersection:</p>
<p>In case of 0, we won’t connect them since they are literally not connected.</p>
<p>In case of 1, we check if that point lies inside the rectangle: Let (xi, yi), then 0 &lt; xi &lt; X &amp;&amp; 0 &lt; yi &lt; Y for the point to lie inside.</p>
<p>In case of 2, if either point fulfils the condition then we can connect them.</p>
<p>To figure out these points, I referred to this article:</p>
<p>[Intersection of Two Circles] <a href="https://paulbourke.net/geometry/circlesphere/">https://paulbourke.net/geometry/circlesphere/</a></p>
<p>For the code:</p>
<p><a href="https://paulbourke.net/geometry/circlesphere/tvoght.c">https://paulbourke.net/geometry/circlesphere/tvoght.c</a></p>
<p>#2 Proper Boundary Touch Condition</p>
<p>The second issue can be easily solved by checking the actual distance of the boundary from the center of the circle and if the distance is less than equal to the radius, means the circle is touching said boundary.</p>
<p>However, in cases (like Ex4 and the image above), we have to be careful while finding distance from the boundary. Because since the x = X boundary ends at y = Y, if we go over this point this distance is measured from (X, Y) instead of from x = X (refer to image for clarity)</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/68da705e-79b3-45e2-9ab9-5cc5b387d032_1723026873.3113623.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>To fix this, for example while calculating distance from right boundary (x = X), we do xDist = |xi - X| and yDist = |min(yi, Y) - yi|</p>
<p>In cases where our circle is below y = Y, ydist becomes 0 and distance is expectedly |xi - X|. In other cases the pythagoras theorem is applied to find the correct distance. (d = sqrt(xDist^2 + yDist^2))</p>
<p>Another important thing done to make the implementation easier was to consider 2 extra nodes in our DSU (n and n+1). n represents (0, 0), (x = 0 aka y axis, right boundary) and (y = Y aka top boundary). n+1 represents (X, Y), (y = 0 aka x axis, bottom boundary) and (x = X aka left boundary). This was done since if a circle is connected to n (via either of the 2 boundaries), and then it gets connected to n+1 (via either of the 2 boundaries), then n and n+1 also get connected. Which basically means our path is blocked.</p>

<p>Do let me know if something requires more clarity, i believe the code itself is self explanatory. Im posting this because the solutions page had no other code which worked after the test cases were updated.</p>
